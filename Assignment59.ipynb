    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The manner in which the random matrices are generated obviously has an impact on the shape of the resulting distributions. The distributions obtained here are both roughly bimodal, and don't shoe the same pronounced skew that the distributions in the previous problem did. Note that we are mixing distributions in generating the matrices using axis and angle sampling as done above, since the unit vectors are chosen using a normal distribution and the angles are chosen using a uniform distribution. The bottom distribution is also shifted slightly relative to the top distribution, another difference with the former sampling methods. The value of the test statistic is over 10 times larger than it was using the prior sampling method, though the p - value we obtain here is indistinguishable from zero. The evidence that the two distributions arise from the same undelying density is thus here slighlty less strong than in the former case, but is still relatively string overall. "
